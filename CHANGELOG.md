# ELSI changelog

## v.2.11.0 (August 2024)

* Add support for external [DLA-Future](https://github.com/eth-cscs/DLA-Future) solver (via [DLA-Future-Fortran](https://github.com/eth-cscs/DLA-Future-Fortran) interface). (Thanks to Rocco Meli!)
* Removed internal ELPA 2023 and ELPA 2024 versions and defaulted to version 2020. We have not been able to create a fully platform-independant version of the source code of the 2023+ versions. For versions above 2023 an external compilation of ELPA ON THE EXACT NODE USED FOR COMPUTATION will be required for now.
* Adjusted chemical potential determination in ELSI's determination of occupation numbers. k-point weights for very dense k-space grids are now handled with higher numerical precision by re-weighting ahead of charge norm determination. In the case of a sufficiently large energy band gap, ELSI now places the chemical potential value halfway between HOMO (VBM) and LUMO (CBM) if possible.
* Added variables to elsi_handle that specify the definition of fractional occupation numbers (vs. integer) and that communicate the method of chemical potential determination (specified by fractional occupation numbers, mid-point between HOMO/LUMO, or no midpoint placement possible while keeping the exact charge norm) back to the user code.
* Added subroutine find_homo_lumo_gap to calculate the HOMO, LUMO levels and the gap.
* Fixed stalling during density matrix calculation by setting n_states_solve to be used across all tasks. (Thanks to Sebastian Kokott!)
* Implemented a more flexible scheme for using GPU strings in ELPA. This also resolves the silent failing of GPU offloading inside ELPA introduced in a previous commit. (Thanks to Alberto Garcia!)
* Fixed compilation issues for PTSCOTCH required by PEXSI due to different versions of bison and flex. (Thanks to Alberto Garcia!)
* Corrected Fortran MPI datatype for long integer. (Thanks to Sebastian Kokott!)
* Patched deprecated MPI calls in the PEXSI subsystem. (Thanks to Sebastian Ehlert and Alberto Garcia!)
* Addressed platform dependent compiler issues in the ChASE solver. (Thanks to Xinzhe Wu!)
* Added support for Intel LLVM compilers.
* Included support for PEXSI v2.0.0. (Thanks to David Williams-Young!)
* Included support for NTPoly v.3.0.0. (Thanks to William Dawson!)
* Included support for EigenExa v2.12.

## v.2.10.0 (November 2023)

* Include ELPA-2023.05.001:
  * ELPA-2023.05.001 is the new default version on Linux for CPUs. If ELSI is run with GPU or on a Mac we still use ELPA-2020.05.001 (the old default). The reasons are build problems we have encountered. This should be resolved with the ELPA-2023.11.001 release.
  * Added support for LLVM compiler (Clang).
  * Different ELPA versions can be enforced by setting `USE_ELPA_2020`, `USE_ELPA_2021`, or `USE_ELPA_2023` in the CMake cache file.
* The Chase solver (v.1.4.0) has been integrated into ELSI.
* The [ChASE](https://chase-library.github.io/ChASE/chase.html) solver (v1.4.0) is integrated into ELSI.
* A new method for calculating static excitation through the delta-SCF method has been implemented.
* An interface with Slate for matrix inversion was added.
* A method to calculate electronic excitations for core-level spectroscopy has been implemented.

## v2.9.1 (May 2022)

Bug fix version to include the interface of integer4.

Add a script for compiling the doc file.

## v2.9.0 (April 2022)

The indices have been updated to integer8 instead of integer4.
This allows us to use a relatively small number of MPI ranks for relatively large matrices.
This update is essential for accelerators (GPU,TPU,...).
The interface is updated so that both integer8 and integer4 should work.

Add Cholesky extrapolation for density matrix when used with elsi restart files.
ovlp_old and dm are read from disk and not stored in the elsi handle, thus, a separate interface was needed.

The single precision is used for forward and backward transformation to the standard eigenvalue problem.
This further save the computational cost in the mixed precision calculations.

We updated the ELPA version to 2021.11.001, the old ELPA version is still the default.
While the new version can be switched on with the cmake option USE_ELPA_2021.

We provide a description and examples for elsipy.

We update EigenExa to 2.11.
